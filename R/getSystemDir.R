#' Get the system installation directory
#'
#' Get the system installation directory for a package.
#' This is not entirely trivial as it may be called before the package is installed.
#'
#' @param pkgname String containing the package name.
#' @param installed Logical scalar specifying whether the package is likely to be installed yet.

#' @author Aaron Lun
#'
#' @return String containing the path to the (likely, if \code{installed=FALSE}) installation directory for \code{pkgname}.

#' @examples
#' getSystemDir("basilisk")

#' @export

        # between *basilisk* installation and client installation;
        # system.file() should still pull out the correct dir.
