\section{Version 1.18.0}{\itemize{
\item Switch to the latest Miniforge installer (24.3.0-0) by default.
This is preconfigured to use the conda-forge channel and avoids issues with the non-FOSS licensing of the Anaconda repositories.
Users can switch back to the old Miniconda installer by setting the \code{BASILISK_USE_MINIFORGE=0} environment variable,
but this will likely be deprecated in the next release.
